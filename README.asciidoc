= BarbaryWatchService

This is the official BarbaryWatchService repository, moved from https://code.google.com/p/barbarywatchservice/

See link:issues/[issues] for current plans.

Anything below is straight from the original repo (changed markup to AsciiDoc and fixed a couple typos)

= An implementation of Java 7's WatchService for Java 6 on Mac OS X

Java 7 has an API to detect file system changes called Watch Service. This project uses JNA to hook into Apple's File System Events API.

This is almost a direct drop-in replacement for Java 7's Watch Service API. I've used the API source code from OpenJDK 7 as much as possible.

There's a link:Demo.asciidoc[Demo example here].

A lot of source code is from OpenJDK.

== Differences from Java 7's API
You obtain a Watch Service instance as follows:

[source,java]
WatchService watcher = WatchService.newWatchService();

Instead of creating Path objects, use `WatchableFile` objects:
[source,java]
WatchableFile file1 = new WatchableFile(new File("/path/to/watch"));
